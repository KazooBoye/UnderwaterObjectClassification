# Three Approaches for Underwater Object Detection: Comparative Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents three distinct approaches for solving a 7-class underwater object detection problem (fish, jellyfish, penguin, puffin, shark, starfish, stingray). Each approach is designed to address the specific challenges identified in the dataset analysis: severe class imbalance (25:1 ratio), multi-scale objects (0.6% to 6% area), complex multi-object scenes (avg 7.6 objects/image), and high shape variability.

**Dataset Overview:**
- **Classes**: 7 underwater creatures with severe imbalance
- **Original Distribution**: Fish (55.4%) to Starfish (2.4%)
- **Challenges**: Multi-scale detection, crowded scenes, shape diversity
- **Preprocessing**: Balanced to ~2000 samples/class using advanced augmentation

## Approach 1: One-Stage Detector (YOLOv8-Based)

### Definition
One-stage detectors perform object detection in a single forward pass, directly predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities from feature maps without requiring a separate region proposal step. This approach uses a modified YOLOv8 architecture optimized for underwater scenarios.

### Architecture Details
```
Input (640x640) 
    ↓
Backbone: CSPDarknet53 with Cross Stage Partial connections
    ↓
Neck: Path Aggregation Network (PAN) + Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)
    ↓
Head: YOLOv8 Detection Head with 3 scales (P3/8, P4/16, P5/32)
    ↓
Output: [batch_size, num_anchors, num_classes + 5] for each scale
```

### Key Modifications for Underwater Dataset
1. **Multi-Scale Anchor Optimization**: Custom anchor sizes for small fish (16x16) to large sharks (256x256)
2. **Class-Weighted Focal Loss**: α=0.25, γ=2.0 with class weights [0.258, 0.992, 1.334, 2.423, 1.944, 5.932, 3.740]
3. **Enhanced Feature Pyramid**: Additional P2/4 scale for tiny object detection
4. **Underwater-Specific Augmentations**: Color jittering, underwater lighting simulation
5. **NMS Optimization**: Class-specific NMS thresholds for handling crowded fish scenes

### Implementation Strategy (TensorFlow/Keras)
```python
# Custom YOLOv8 implementation using tf.keras
class UnderwaterYOLOv8(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=7):
        super().__init__()
        self.backbone = CSPDarknet53()
        self.neck = PANFPN(channels=[256, 512, 1024])
        self.head = YOLOv8Head(num_classes=num_classes, num_anchors=3)
        
    def call(self, x):
        # Multi-scale feature extraction
        p3, p4, p5 = self.backbone(x)
        # Feature fusion
        features = self.neck([p3, p4, p5])
        # Detection
        outputs = self.head(features)
        return outputs
```

### Pros
**Fast Training**: Single-stage training, end-to-end optimization
**Real-time Inference**: 30-60 FPS on modern GPUs
**Memory Efficient**: Lower memory footprint than two-stage detectors
**Anchor-based Stability**: Proven anchor-based detection for diverse object sizes
**Strong Community Support**: Extensive YOLOv8 ecosystem and pretrained models
**Handle Crowded Scenes**: Efficient NMS handles multiple fish instances
**Multi-scale Detection**: Native support for objects ranging from tiny to large

### Cons
**Localization Precision**: Slightly less precise bounding boxes than two-stage methods
**Small Object Challenges**: May struggle with very small distant fish
**Imbalance Sensitivity**: Requires careful loss function tuning for rare classes
**Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Many parameters to tune (anchors, NMS thresholds)
**Limited Feature Refinement**: Single forward pass limits feature refinement

### Expected Performance
- **mAP@0.5**: 82-88%
- **mAP@0.5:0.95**: 65-72%
- **Inference Speed**: 25-35ms per image
- **Training Time**: 8-12 hours on modern GPU
- **Best Classes**: Fish, Jellyfish, Shark (larger, more samples)
- **Challenging Classes**: Starfish, Puffin (small, rare)

## Approach 2: Two-Stage Detector (Faster R-CNN with Feature Pyramid Network)

### Definition
Two-stage detectors separate the detection task into two sequential stages: (1) Region Proposal Network (RPN) generates object proposals, and (2) Classification and regression heads refine these proposals. This approach uses Faster R-CNN with FPN backbone optimized for multi-scale underwater objects.

### Architecture Details
```
Input (800x800)
    ↓
Backbone: ResNet-101 + Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)
    ↓
Stage 1: Region Proposal Network (RPN)
    ├─ Objectness Classification (object/background)
    └─ Bounding Box Regression (coarse localization)
    ↓
ROI Align: Extract features for proposed regions
    ↓
Stage 2: Detection Head
    ├─ Classification: 7 classes + background
    └─ Bounding Box Refinement: Precise localization
    ↓
Output: Final detections with precise bounding boxes
```

### Key Modifications for Underwater Dataset
1. **Multi-Scale RPN**: 5 scales (32, 64, 128, 256, 512) with 3 aspect ratios (0.5, 1.0, 2.0)
2. **Class-Balanced Sampling**: Hard negative mining with 1:3 positive:negative ratio
3. **FPN Integration**: Feature Pyramid Network for consistent multi-scale representation
4. **ROI Align**: Precise feature extraction for accurate localization
5. **Underwater Pretrained Backbone**: ImageNet → Underwater domain adaptation
6. **Ensemble NMS**: Soft-NMS with sigma=0.5 to preserve overlapping fish detections

### Implementation Strategy (TensorFlow)
```python
# Faster R-CNN with FPN using TensorFlow Object Detection API
import tensorflow as tf
from object_detection.models import faster_rcnn_resnet_v1_feature_extractor

class UnderwaterFasterRCNN(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=7):
        super().__init__()
        self.backbone = FasterRCNNResNet101FPN()
        self.rpn = RegionProposalNetwork(anchor_scales=[32, 64, 128, 256, 512])
        self.roi_head = ROIHead(num_classes=num_classes + 1)  # +1 for background
        
    def call(self, images, targets=None):
        # Feature extraction
        feature_maps = self.backbone(images)
        # Region proposals
        proposals, rpn_losses = self.rpn(feature_maps, targets)
        # Final detection
        detections, roi_losses = self.roi_head(feature_maps, proposals, targets)
        return detections, (rpn_losses, roi_losses)
```

### Pros
**Superior Localization**: Two-stage refinement produces highly accurate bounding boxes
**Robust to Scale Variation**: FPN handles 0.6%-6% area range effectively
**Better Small Object Detection**: RPN + ROI pipeline excellent for tiny fish
**Class Imbalance Resilience**: Two-stage training naturally handles imbalanced data
**Flexible Architecture**: Easy to swap backbones and add components
**Precise Feature Extraction**: ROI Align provides sub-pixel accuracy
**Proven Performance**: State-of-the-art results on COCO and similar datasets

### Cons
**Slower Training**: Two-stage optimization requires more compute time
**Higher Memory Usage**: Feature maps for both stages consume significant memory
**Complex Architecture**: More components to tune and debug
**Slower Inference**: 100-200ms per image, not suitable for real-time
**Hyperparameter Complexity**: RPN and ROI head both require careful tuning
**Potential Overfitting**: Complex model may overfit on limited minority class data

### Expected Performance
- **mAP@0.5**: 85-91%
- **mAP@0.5:0.95**: 70-78%
- **Inference Speed**: 150-200ms per image
- **Training Time**: 15-20 hours on modern GPU
- **Best Classes**: All classes due to two-stage refinement
- **Challenging Classes**: Still Starfish (limited data), but better than one-stage

## Approach 3: Transformer-Based Detector (DETR with Underwater Adaptations)

### Definition
Detection Transformer (DETR) revolutionizes object detection by treating it as a set prediction problem using transformer architecture. It eliminates the need for hand-crafted components like anchors and NMS by directly outputting a fixed set of predictions, making it particularly suitable for complex underwater scenes with varying object counts.

### Architecture Details
```
Input (800x800)
    ↓
CNN Backbone: ResNet-50 + Positional Encoding
    ↓
Transformer Encoder: 6 layers with multi-head self-attention
    ├─ Global context understanding
    └─ Feature relationship modeling
    ↓
Transformer Decoder: 6 layers with cross-attention
    ├─ Object Queries (100 learnable embeddings)
    └─ Set Prediction
    ↓
Output: 100 predictions [class + bbox], bipartite matching during training
```

### Key Modifications for Underwater Dataset
1. **Increased Object Queries**: 150 queries to handle up to 56 objects per image
2. **Underwater-Aware Positional Encoding**: 2D spatial + depth-aware encoding
3. **Class-Balanced Hungarian Matching**: Weighted bipartite matching favoring rare classes
4. **Multi-Scale Deformable Attention**: Focus on relevant scales for each object type
5. **Auxiliary Detection Losses**: Additional losses at intermediate decoder layers
6. **Scene Context Modeling**: Global attention captures underwater environment relationships

### Implementation Strategy (TensorFlow)
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

class UnderwaterDETR(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=7, num_queries=150):
        super().__init__()
        self.backbone = tf.keras.applications.ResNet50(include_top=False, weights='imagenet')
        self.pos_encoder = PositionalEncoding2D()
        self.transformer_encoder = TransformerEncoder(num_layers=6, d_model=256)
        self.transformer_decoder = TransformerDecoder(num_layers=6, d_model=256)
        self.object_queries = self.add_weight(
            shape=(num_queries, 256), initializer='random_normal', name='object_queries'
        )
        self.class_head = layers.Dense(num_classes + 1)  # +1 for "no object"
        self.bbox_head = layers.Dense(4)
        
    def call(self, images):
        # Feature extraction
        features = self.backbone(images)  # [B, H, W, C]
        features = tf.reshape(features, [tf.shape(features)[0], -1, tf.shape(features)[-1]])
        
        # Add positional encoding
        pos_encoded_features = self.pos_encoder(features)
        
        # Encoder: understand global context
        encoded_features = self.transformer_encoder(pos_encoded_features)
        
        # Decoder: generate object predictions
        batch_size = tf.shape(images)[0]
        queries = tf.tile(self.object_queries[None], [batch_size, 1, 1])
        decoded_features = self.transformer_decoder(queries, encoded_features)
        
        # Prediction heads
        class_logits = self.class_head(decoded_features)  # [B, num_queries, num_classes+1]
        bbox_coords = self.bbox_head(decoded_features)     # [B, num_queries, 4]
        
        return {'class_logits': class_logits, 'bbox_coords': bbox_coords}
```

### Pros
**No NMS Required**: Direct set prediction eliminates post-processing complexity
**Global Context Understanding**: Transformer captures scene-wide relationships
**Flexible Object Count**: Handles 0-56 objects per image naturally
**End-to-End Training**: Unified loss function without staged optimization
**Attention Visualization**: Interpretable attention maps for model understanding

**Memory Intensive**: Self-attention operations consume significant memory
**Limited Pretrained Models**: Fewer pretrained weights available for underwater domain
**Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Many transformer-specific parameters to tune
**Implementation Complexity**: More complex than traditional CNN-based detectors

### Expected Performance
- **mAP@0.5**: 83-89%
- **mAP@0.5:0.95**: 68-75%
- **Inference Speed**: 80-120ms per image
- **Training Time**: 25-35 hours on modern GPU
- **Best Classes**: Fish (benefits from global context), Jellyfish (attention to transparency)
- **Challenging Classes**: All minority classes due to data requirements
